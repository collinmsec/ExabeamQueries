NOTE: Some of these fields that are being used may be different in your environment depending on parsing. 

Root User Login: 
(Product:"AWS CloudTrail" AND event_name:"ConsoleLogin") AND user_identity:"root"

IF user identity field is not parsed & Regex is needed: 
(Product:"AWS CloudTrail" AND event_name:"ConsoleLogin") AND RGXi("userIdentity\"\:\{\"type\"\:\"root")
